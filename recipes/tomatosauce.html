    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Is there anything simpler, more satisfying than a good plate of pasta? I'd
      certainly be hard-pressed to name anything. Maybe a plate of pasta that I
      didn't have to do anything to create, but that's neither here nor there.
      This is a recipe website, so you're still going to have to actually do the
      work to produce these dishes. Unless you're the type of person who can
      just email your personal assistant a recipe you want to try, and by the
      time you get home from a hard day on the set of the new blockbuster
      superhero epic, your chef has been slaving over a hot stove all day to
      produce whatever delectable dish your heart desires. But that probably
      isn't your vibe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I digress. The point is: a simple, well-made pasta sauce is one of life's
      great joys, and I happen to have one that could bring a tear to your
      eye&#8212;that is, if you didn't already waste all your tears shooting the
      second-act breakup scene with Jennifer Aniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to a good, and I really mean <em>good</em>, not just Olive
      Garden-good, pasta sauce, there is one secret ingredient that trumps all
      others: time. That's right: the good old passage of second, minutes, and,
      crucially for this recipe, hours. This particular sauce doesn't even hit
      its stride until the second hour rolls around, but ideally you should
      shoot for three. I know that sounds like a tall order in this
      hustle-bustle-TikTok-ADHD world of flying cars and 3-second viral videos,
      but if you really want to make a tomato sauce you can be proud of, you're
      going to have to put in the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And notice I said "put in the <em>time</em>," not "put in the
      <em>work</em>." This recipe is "Simple," like it says at the top of the
      screen. Despite the amount of time it takes to cook this sauce, the actual
      work you have to put in is fairly minimal, and most of the ingredients are
      things you already have in your kitchen. You do a little work up front,
      then you get to, as Ron Popeil once said, set it and forget it. And three
      hours later, (well, maybe a bit longer than three hours*) you've got
      yourself what I promise will be one of the best sauces you've ever
      tasted&#8212;OR YOUR MONEY BACK!

      * There is a lot of discussion in the foodie community how and how long
      flavors take to develop. A lot of people, notably J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, the
      brilliant food scientist of America's Test Kitchen, New York Times
      Cooking, and Serious Eats fame, insist that the flavors within
      stews&#8212;in this case a pasta sauce, but really anything cooked in
      liquid in a pot for a long time, including traditional stews and
      chili&#8212;take a <em>long</em> time to mature. In his excellent
      cookbook/textbook The Food Lab, Lopez-Alt recommends not even eating chili
      the same day you make it. He says to turn off the heat, let it come to
      room temp, put it in the fridge, and wait overnight
      <em>at minimum</em> before enjoying. Heck, he actually says it can take up
      to a <em>week</em> for the flavors to fully develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now while I would trust Kenji with my life on all things culinary,
      sometimes you have to follow your gut, not your brain. I say three hours
      and straight on the plate is plenty fine for this pasta sauce. Do I think
      there is an appreciable difference in flavor after the sauce has cooled?
      Yes. I'd be lying if I said otherwise. My honest recommendation would be
      to simmer for 3 hours and leave the pot sitting on the stove at least long
      enough to come down to room temp. This definitely improves the flavor, and
      not burning the hell out of your tongue is a big bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But! I realize that being in a house filled with the savory aromas of
      stewing tomatoes, garlic, and aromatics for 3-plus hours, especially on a
      cold winter afternoon, can create a hunger stronger than the strongest
      smart-guy lecture about phenols and tannins and culinary chemical
      reactions, Maillard and otherwise. The <s>heart</s> stomach know what the
      <s>heart</s> stomach wants. If you can't wait another second to eat this
      delicious, hearty, stick-to-your-ribs-and-your-spoon pasta sauce, you go
      right ahead. There will still be sauce left for tomorrow, and you can rest
      easy knowing that it will taste even better then!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Two 28oz cans whole peeled tomatoes (any variety will do)</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>10 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2½ tbsp dried basil</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 tbsp dried parsley</li>
      <li>½ tsp red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp white sugar</li>
      <li>about 1-2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 large anchovies, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>¾ cups water</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 300° and move rack to lower-middle so that a dutch oven
        will fit with its lid on. Crush canned tomatoes by hand in a large bowl,
        into roughly ½ inch pieces. Be careful, as the tomatoes have a tendency
        to squirt liquid when crushed.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a dutch oven, heat olive oil (about 2 tbsp) on medium-high. Cook
        onion until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, anchovies, and tomato
        paste, cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add basil, red pepper
        flakes, salt, and sugar. Stir to combine. Add butter and cook for one
        more minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half the tomatoes and deglaze the dutch oven (cook on high for about
        30 seconds while scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon).
        Add remaining tomatoes and water. Bring back up to medium heat and bring
        to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer dutch oven to preheated oven. Cover, leaving lid slightly ajar.
        Cook 2-3 hours, removing dutch oven every 30 minutes to stir and make
        sure sauce is not burning. Make sure the sauce is still at a simmer
        before returning to oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 3 hours, move dutch oven to stove or countertop to cool,
        uncovered, until it has reached room temperature. At this point, you can
        re-warm the sauce and serve, or move to refrigerator overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
