    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ahh bread, that most essential of essential foodstuffs. It can cover the
      gamut, from soft and fluffy to hard and crusty, from gooey-sweet to salty
      and savory, from snow-white to black-as-coal, white to pumpernickel,
      sourdough to monkeybread, more processed than a Twinkie to a dusty,
      hand-wrought farmhouse loaf. There are few places in the kitchen or on the
      dining table where bread doesn't belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I have never been especially gifted when it comes to the baking
      arts, I was fortunate to be hipped to the revolutionary concept of the
      bread machine (or "countertop breadmaker," if you want to avoid any
      potential trademark infringement concerns) by a good friend of mine
      earlier this year. The thing couldn't be more simple: put all the crap in
      the machine, press Start, and 3 hours later you've got a loaf of
      fresh-baked bread. That's it. No kneading, no punching, no rolling pins,
      no flour-covered floors or countertops, nothing but a delicious, steaming
      loaf of any kind of bread you desire, for pennies on the dollar compared
      to the cost of store-bought bread. There is literally no downside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But wait," you're saying, "I don't <em>have</em> a bread machine!" Ah,
      but here's the other incredible thing about them: go to any thrift store.
      I'll wait...
    </p>
    <p>
      So? How many bread machines did you see? 3? 5? 8? That's the thing:
      they're everywhere! Any secondhand store, Goodwill, church-affiliated
      thrift establishment in a rundown strip mall&#8212; they're bound to have
      multiple bread machines, and for cheap! You shouldn't have to spend more
      than $20, and $10-15 isn't out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Secondhand appliances?? Isn't that unsanitary?" you say. And I'm frankly
      disappointed. You've got two perfectly good eyes. Do you see anything
      wrong with the bread machine? Crusted-on flour? Weird stains? Nicks and
      dings? Fine. Don't buy it. But just look at a few of these things and
      you'll quickly be able to tell the good from the bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there isn't much bad! The bread machine is a very simple device: a
      non-stick pan, a paddle, a motor, a heating element, a couple of buttons,
      and a digital display. That's it. Not much can go wrong. Unless the person
      who owned it before simply didn't clean it at all, the non-stick surface
      means it doesn't take more than some running water and a paper towel to
      clean out the pan, which is about all you'll need to do when you take your
      new (used) bread machine home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as the actual baking process goes, there are a few things you'll
      need to remember:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Always put the wet ingredients in before the dry. It's imperative that
        the yeast does not get wet or come into contact with salt before it's
        good and ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ingredients must be at room temperature when they go into the bread
        machine. Don't ask me why. This is simply an unalterable rule of
        breadmaking. (The only exception is if you have a newer bread maker that
        includes a warming step. You'll have to check your manual to find this
        out.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Always use <em>bread</em> flour, not all-purpose flour. AP flour does
        not contain the correct amount of... flour stuff. Just trust me.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a variety of yeasts at your local supermarket. You are going
        to want yeast that is labeled "bread machine," "bread maker," "rapid
        rise," "fast rise," or "instant rise." Why there need to be 20 different
        names for the same thing is anyone's guess, but that's just the way the
        shady yeast cartel [citation needed] does things.
        <br />
        Also note: unless you are going to be making <em>a lot</em> of bread, I
        recommend buying yeast that comes in pouches. Since yeast is a living
        creature, it can, sadly, die. The little pouches are sealed, preventing
        an untimely yeast-death until you're good and ready to use it. The jars
        of yeast must be kept refrigerated, and even then will still lose their
        potency within a couple of weeks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients (for a 2lb bread maker)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>345ml whole milk</li>
      <li>57g butter</li>
      <li>28g instant potato flakes</li>
      <li>420g bread flour</li>
      <li>1¼ tsp salt</li>
      <li>25g sugar</li>
      <li>1½ tsp yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place ingredients in bread maker in the order shown above. Create a
        divot in the flour with your thumb to hold the yeast. Remember to keep
        the yeast separated from the liquid as well as the salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close the lid of your bread maker and set it to 2lb loaf and Light
        crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the cycle completes, in 3-4 hours, remove the loaf to a wire
        cooling rack and allow at least 15 minutes to cool before slicing and
        serving. The longer you allow the bread to cool, the easier it will be
        to slice.
      </li>
    </ol>
