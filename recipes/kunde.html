    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kunde is a Kenyan stew made with peanuts (or peanut butter) and black-eyed
      peas. There's not much else to it, but it is incredibly rich, hearty, and
      delicious. The short ingredient list means it is quick to make as well! If
      you want to use canned ingredients, it can be made even quicker, without
      affecting the flavor too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way I happened on kunde is kind of a funny story. I got into eating
      beans this year, for whatever reason&#8212;I think maybe because I once
      read that they were the healthiest food in the world, pound-for-pound, and
      I had been trying to eat more healthfully&#8212;and found myself digging
      into a can of black-eyed peas (beans and peas are the same thing in my
      book. And all the other books as well, honestly). Something about the
      rich, earthy aroma of the black-eyed peas stirred something inside of me
      and I was compelled by the bizarre thought, "God, these could really use
      some peanut butter." It seemed, at the time, a strange connection to have
      made, reminiscent of the odd cravings for food combinations that pregnant
      women get, but I had nothing to lose, so I dropped a few dollops of peanut
      butter in the bowl and was immediately transported to Flavortown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The taste of the black-eyed peas and peanut butter was so perfect that,
      after reclining in my dining chair and uttering a satisfied belch, I
      whipped out my phone and googled "black-eyed peas and peanut butter," and,
      lo-and-behold, kunde was the first result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I wouldn't say that I was <em>disappointed</em> to see that the fine
      people of Kenya had beat me to the punch by probably centuries, but it
      would have been nice to have been the sole discoverer of a flavor
      combination this gobsmackingly delicious&#8212; me: an explorer of
      undiscovered gastronomical worlds, a culinary Magellan, brow furrowed,
      three sheets to the wind, setting sail into uncharted waters with nothing
      but a fork, a spoon, and the steadfast sense of my noble gut to guide
      me...
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, this stew is fantastic, though I had nothing whatsoever to do
      with its creation. Bon appetit!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ¼ cup unsalted roasted peanuts or 3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 large tomato finely chopped</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Two 15.5-ounce cans black-eyed peas, drained and liquid reserved</li>
      <li>½ cup water or chicken stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If using whole peanuts, place them in a food processor and pulse until
        finely ground, almost like sand. Set the peanuts aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm the oil in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Add the onion
        and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the coriander and turmeric and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about
        30 seconds. Add the tomato and a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until the liquid from the tomato has evaporated and the
        mixture is quite dry, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the peas, peanuts (or peanut butter, if using), and water, increase
        the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to
        low and simmer just until the peas have absorbed some of the wonderful
        flavor, about 5 minutes. Season the peas to taste with salt and serve
        immediately, while hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
